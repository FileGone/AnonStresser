I know you are smart but just to mention it incase of confusing.
All neccessery files related to the files above also needs to be included in the re-theme process.

And make sure the popup on home page shows on the new design.
It is also important that the last winner appears and works on the new design.

Also make sure it looks like the pic in preview photo

Also note that all html folders, well basically all folders needs to stay as they are, 
anything of that being touched, removed or functions gettings tuckled with will break something which...
Will cause errors here and there from time to time.!
